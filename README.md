## How Ads and Trackers Actually Work

When you load a webpage or open an app, multiple DNS queries occur:

1. **Primary Domain Resolution**: Your device resolves the main website domain
2. **Third-Party Resource Loading**: The page pulls content from numerous external domains:
   - Ad networks and exchanges (Google Ads, Facebook Ads)
   - Analytics and telemetry (Google Analytics, Hotjar, Mouseflow, Sentry, Bugsnag)
   - Content delivery networks for images, videos, scripts
3. **Ad Delivery Methods**:
   - **Third-party assets**: Scripts and images from ad/tracker domains
   - **First-party serving**: Ads served from the same domain as the main site
   - **Dynamic injection**: JavaScript-inserted content after page load
4. **DNS Bypass Attempts**: Modern browsers may use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT) to bypass local DNS filtering

**Key Insight**: DNS filtering excels at blocking entire domains before any connection is made, but cannot modify content already delivered from allowed domains.

---

## Why DNS Filtering Cannot Reach 100%

DNS filtering has inherent limitations:

- **Domain-level blocking only**: Cannot block specific URLs or modify page content
- **Same-site content**: Cannot hide banners or elements hosted on the main domain
- **Dynamic content**: Cannot block JavaScript-injected ads that load after DNS resolution
- **Testing methodology**: Ad-blocking test sites often check same-site images and inline scripts

**Solution**: Layer DNS filtering with browser-based content blockers (like uBlock Origin) for comprehensive coverage. DNS provides network-wide protection, while browser extensions handle page-level filtering.

---

## What We're Building

A privacy-first, multi-layered DNS security stack:

- **Pi-hole**: Network-wide domain blocking with comprehensive logging
- **Unbound**: Local recursive DNS resolver for maximum privacy
- **Cloudflared**: Encrypted DoH fallback to Quad9 for resilience
- **Hagezi Multi Pro**: Premium blocklist covering ads, trackers, malware, and telemetry
- **Strict ordering**: Privacy-first upstream resolution (no DNS racing)
- **Complete visibility**: Full query logging and device-level control

## Component Roles

**Pi-hole**  
DNS sinkhole and policy engine. Applies blocklists, custom rules, and provides comprehensive logging. Blocks domains at the network layer for all device applications.

**Unbound**  
Local recursive resolver that starts at DNS root servers, validates responses with DNSSEC, and ensures complete privacy by eliminating third-party DNS logging.

**Cloudflared (proxy-dns)**  
Lightweight DNS over HTTPS forwarder providing encrypted fallback to Quad9. Only used when Unbound fails, never in parallel.

**Hagezi Multi Pro**  
Curated, high-quality blocklist covering ads, trackers, telemetry, phishing, and security threats without manual domain maintenance.

---

## Complete Setup Process

### Step 1: Assign Stable IP Address

Configure DHCP reservation on your router to ensure the Pi maintains the same IP address. Avoid setting both static IP and DHCP reservation simultaneously.

### Step 2: Install Pi-hole

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

During installation:
- Choose your network interface (typically eth0 for Ethernet)
- Select upstream DNS providers (we'll change these later)
- Choose blocklists (we'll add premium lists later)
- Set admin interface password

After installation, access the admin interface at `http://<pi-ip>/admin`

### Step 3: Install and Configure Unbound

Install Unbound recursive DNS resolver:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install unbound -y
wget -O root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root
sudo mv root.hints /var/lib/unbound/root.hints
```

Create Unbound configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```bash
server:
    interface: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5335
    do-ip4: yes
    do-udp: yes
    do-tcp: yes
    access-control: 127.0.0.0/8 allow

    root-hints: "/var/lib/unbound/root.hints"

    hide-identity: yes
    hide-version: yes
    harden-glue: yes
    harden-dnssec-stripped: yes
    use-caps-for-id: no
    prefetch: yes

    # Performance optimization
    num-threads: 2
    msg-cache-size: 8m
    rrset-cache-size: 16m
    so-rcvbuf: 1m
```

Start and enable Unbound:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart unbound
sudo systemctl enable unbound
```

### Step 4: Configure Pi-hole DNS Upstream

Access Pi-hole Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí DNS:
- Uncheck all predefined upstream servers
- Set Custom 1 (IPv4) to `127.0.0.1#5335` (Unbound)

Enable strict ordering to prevent DNS racing:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/99-strict-order.conf
```

Add:

```bash
strict-order
```

Restart Pi-hole DNS:

```bash
sudo pihole restartdns
```

### Step 5: Configure Encrypted DoH Fallback

Install cloudflared and create systemd service:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cloudflared-proxy-dns.service
```

Add service configuration:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=cloudflared DNS over HTTPS proxy
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cloudflared proxy-dns --port 5053 --upstream https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query
Restart=on-failure
User=nobody

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared-proxy-dns
sudo systemctl start cloudflared-proxy-dns
sudo systemctl status cloudflared-proxy-dns
```

Add DoH fallback to Pi-hole:
- Settings ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Custom 2 (IPv4): `127.0.0.1#5053`

- **Performance improvements** through reduced network requests
- **Complementary protection** that works alongside browser-level blockers

---

## DNS Privacy and Leak Testing

Verify that DNS queries remain private and don't leak to third-party resolvers.

![DNS Leak Test Results](media/image11.png)  
*DNS leak test showing only Comcast ISP resolver detected, confirming no DNS leaks to third-party services and proper local resolution*

### Privacy Validation Results

The DNS leak test confirms:
- **Single ISP Resolver**: Only Comcast Cable detected (normal for unbound fallback)
- **No Third-Party Leaks**: No Google, Cloudflare, or other public DNS detected
- **Geographic Consistency**: All resolvers in West Haven, United States (expected location)
- **Unbound Privacy**: Local recursive resolution working correctly

Key privacy indicators:
- **Query Locality**: DNS resolution handled locally by Unbound
- **No Logging**: Third-party services not seeing DNS queries
- **Encrypted Fallback**: When used, DoH to Quad9 maintains encryption
- **ISP Transparency**: Only ISP-level routing visible (unavoidable)

This confirms the privacy architecture is working:
1. **Primary**: Unbound resolves directly from root servers (private)
2. **Fallback**: Encrypted DoH to Quad9 when needed (encrypted)
3. **No Leaks**: Browser and OS DNS settings properly configured

---

## Results and Performance

Comprehensive analysis of the implemented DNS security stack.

### Privacy Achievements
- **DNS Leak Protection**: All queries resolved locally by Unbound during normal operation
- **Zero Third-party Logging**: No DNS history shared with external providers
- **Encrypted Fallback**: DoH to Quad9 when needed, maintaining encryption
- **Complete Query Visibility**: Full insight into all network DNS activity

### Security Benefits
- **DNSSEC Validation**: Protection against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning
- **Malware Domain Blocking**: Hagezi lists block known malicious domains
- **Phishing Protection**: Multi-layered domain reputation filtering
- **Tracker Elimination**: Comprehensive blocking of analytics and telemetry

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster Page Loading**: Elimination of ad/tracker network requests
- **Reduced Bandwidth**: Significant decrease in unwanted content downloads
- **Network-wide Coverage**: Protection extends to all devices and applications

- **Network Scope**: Covers all connected devices without individual configuration
- **Bypass Mitigation**: Prevents common DNS over HTTPS circumvention attempts

### Measured Results

Based on testing screenshots:
- **80.3% Block Rate**: 4,142 out of 5,161 queries blocked on main dashboard
- **95% Ad-Block Test**: 127 out of 134 trackers blocked in comprehensive testing
- **Sub-second Response**: Query times ranging from 0.3ms to 85ms
- **440,402 Blocked Domains**: Extensive blocklist coverage
- **Zero DNS Leaks**: Complete privacy validation in leak testing

### Reality Check
DNS filtering provides excellent network-wide protection but has inherent limitations:
- Cannot block same-domain hosted ads or inline content
- Aggressive ad-testing sites may show partial scores with DNS-only blocking
- Browser-level content blockers (uBlock Origin) complement DNS filtering for 100% coverage
- The combination provides comprehensive protection: DNS for network-wide coverage, browser extensions for page-level filtering

This architecture prioritizes privacy, security, and network-wide protection while acknowledging that different blocking methods serve complementary purposes in a comprehensive ad-blocking strategy.
